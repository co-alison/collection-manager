# Collection Manager Application

## CPSC 210 W2 Personal Project

This application will help you keep track of your various collections, whether it be Funko Pop!, Hot Wheels, spoons, 
pins, or sneakers. If you're a beginner collector with one common item, or an avid collector with a hundred rare items, 
the collection manager is **perfect**. 

Users will be able to: 
- add/delete items from their collection
- view all items, 
- log current market prices, release dates, purchase dates, original prices, rarity, and any other details related to the 
item.
- categorize items based on type

As someone who enjoys collecting and watching my collection grow over the years, I often find myself forgetting 
important details. If I want to sell some of my items in 10 years, I would like to know how much I profited, or if I 
waited too long to sell. In addition, I'm a member of a family of collectors. With everyone having different interests,
I want to be able to view and store information about different collections from the same place. I'm hoping to extend
this passion to fellow collectors, or anyone who wants to start!
